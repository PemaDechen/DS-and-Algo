// TODO:  2: Bank Ledger Audit (Range Query)Your bank ledger records transactions (positive for deposits, negative for withdrawals). An auditor asks for the net change across several different time periods.Input Array ($A$): [-3, 6, 2, 4, -1, 5, 2, 8]Task (Query 1): Find the sum of transactions in the range [2, 5] (indices 2 through 5, inclusive).Task (Query 2): Find the sum of transactions in the range [0, 3] (indices 0 through 3, inclusive).
// TODO: Q3: Mountain Hiking (Carry Forward)You are hiking a trail and counting the number of "Peak Lookouts." A spot is a Peak Lookout if every single point on the trail before it was lower in elevation.Input Array (Elevations): [5, 4, 6, 3, 7, 2, 9]Task: Count the total number of Peak Lookouts (including the first point, which is always one).
// TODO: Q4: Inventory Matching (Two Pointers - Sorted)A factory needs to find exactly two parts whose costs sum up to a target assembly cost. The list of part costs is already sorted.Input Array (Sorted Costs, $A$): [1, 5, 9, 12, 15, 20]Target Cost ($T$): 24Task: Determine if a pair of parts exists that sums exactly to 24. If yes, state the indices or values.
// TODO: Q5: Data Locality (Index Tracking - Min/Max)A sensor network recorded values. You need to find the shortest continuous period (subarray) that captures both the lowest recorded value ($\text{Min}$) and the highest recorded value ($\text{Max}$).Input Array ($A$): [2, 4, 1, 5, 9, 3, 1, 8, 9, 7]Task:Identify the global $\text{Min}$ and $\text{Max}$ values.Find the length of the smallest contiguous subarray containing both those values.  1
